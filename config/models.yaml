# Model Registry
#
# All models are registered here with a unified interface.
# Each model defines:
#   - type: Model type (unet, dino)
#   - For DINO: timm_name, feature_dim, patch_size
#   - For U-Net: features list
#
# Normalization is automatically loaded from timm model config for DINO models.
# U-Net models use simple [0,1] scaling (no normalization).
#
# Usage in config:
#   model:
#     backbone: unet_base  # or dinov3_sat_large, etc.

# Normalization presets (fallback if timm config unavailable)
